//In developing countries like India most of the customers buy milk from a seller who have his own dairy animals and not from the retail stores.
//Sometimes the seller take an advantage of this and to make more profits mix water to the milk.
//It's a big concern for a country since milk is very essential especially for growing children
//I propose using smart contract between buyers and sellers to grade the milk quality with reliable instruments and set prices according to the grade.
//Pass the quantity and grade to the contract and calculate the cost.
//Send the same amount of ether to the seller.
